Fixes found by checking the user guide against the code.

- The Stage Shape card's task-to-stage rule (`SHAPE`) now fires when the longest task runs for more than half its stage's wall-clock and over 3× the median task, on a stage that takes at least 0.5% of the run. It compared the longest task against 3× the stage's wall-clock, which a task inside its stage can't reach, so it never fired. Its value is now that share of the stage, such as 0.99, and the `stageShape` detector reports version 2 with two new tunable thresholds, `stageShareMin` and `taskStageSkewFloorPct`; `skewWarn` is now the ratio to the median task.
- In MCP, a local file or folder that isn't a decodable event log reports `invalid-event-log`, the code a History Server archive that fails to decode already reported, instead of `access-or-upstream-failure`. `list_runs` reports `upstream-unreachable` when the History Server refuses the connection or times out, as `diagnose_run` does.
- Redaction replaces the app name with the app id's pseudonym everywhere: `diagnose_run`, `get_run_summary`, the CLI's `--redact` report and HTML export, and the dashboard's **Redact identifiers** export, as `list_runs` already did. `spark.app.name` in the exported config is replaced too.
- The run comparison labels its whole-run `memoryBytesSpilled` total "Memory spill" instead of "Shuffle spill". The `shuffleSpill` key is unchanged.
- The `sparkforensics-server` `/mcp` endpoint is documented in the MCP tools guide and in `--help`.
