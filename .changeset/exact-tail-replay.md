Skew and straggler estimates now replay each stage's own tasks instead of estimating the tail from P50, P95 and max. The parser schedules the stage's tasks in launch order on its observed peak slots twice, once as they ran and once with every task over 4x the median capped at the median, and the finding claims the difference. Clustered late stragglers now claim more, a long task that overlapped the rest of the stage claims less, and a speculation-driven stage with no task over 4x the median claims nothing. On 14 real logs this adds 4 findings, removes 2 and re-bands 5; every non-info estimate is within 2x of the replay (98 of 101 before).
