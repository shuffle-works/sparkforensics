`CachingOpportunity.tsx` now renders each finding's own confidence badge next to its row instead of a single shared low-confidence caveat below the table, matching the `cachingReuseConfidence` scaling the `cachingOpportunity` detector already applies per finding. Docs across `docs-content/detection` (`cache.md`, `chrn.md`, `local.md`, `mem.md`, `spec.md`) and `docs-site/contributor-guide/architecture` (`board-widgets.md`, `detector-contract.md`, `impact-estimation.md`, `state-and-history.md`, `widget-rendering.md`) now describe scaled `low`/`medium`/`high` confidence instead of a hardcoded value for `cachingOpportunity`, `autoscalingChurn`, `coreLocality`, and `memoryUtilization`'s waste-model, and `widget-rendering.md` drops `CachingOpportunity.tsx` from its confidence-exception list now that it's down to one named exception.
