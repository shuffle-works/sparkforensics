Bump vitest and @vitest/coverage-v8 from 4.1.11 to 5.0.1 everywhere (root, packages/core, packages/cli, packages/mcp). This also collapses packages/server's own already-bumped `vitest@^5.0.1` back into a single hoisted install, since every workspace member now shares the same major version.

Two config changes went with it: `vitest.config.js`'s `poolOptions.threads.{execArgv,maxThreads}` moved to the top-level `execArgv`/`maxWorkers` options per v5's pool-options rework, and `packages/core/vitest.config.js` now excludes `src/docs-content/**` from coverage: v5's coverage-v8 remaps uncovered files through Rolldown, which errored trying to parse that directory's markdown reference content as JS.
