The landing page now probes for a reachable local Spark History Server (an empty `fetch(/shs-proxy)` that returns 400 when a server is present, versus a network error or 404 on a static deploy) and, when one responds, shows a neutral callout above "Other sources" pointing the user at the disclosure to fetch a run from it directly. The disclosure itself still doesn't move or auto-expand, and nothing renders until the probe resolves, so a static deploy with no server sees no change.

The "Fetch from Spark History Server" and "Other sources" toggles now show a chevron that flips between down and up as each opens and closes, instead of only changing `aria-expanded` with no visual difference. The Base URL, Application ID, and Attempt ID fields also remember their last values across visits, so a returning user isn't retyping them.
