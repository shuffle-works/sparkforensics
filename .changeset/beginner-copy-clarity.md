Clarify two beginner-facing messages. The "not a Spark event log" parse error now says "no application-start event found" and points to the docs instead of naming the internal `SparkListenerApplicationStart` event class. The Scorecard's wall-clock and efficiency tiles spell out "No stage activity recorded" for a zero-activity run instead of chaining into the shared `—` "no value" glyph, which read as broken data rather than an empty run.
