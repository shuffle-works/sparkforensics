Parser: SQL execution events no longer carry or retain `physicalPlanDescription` (Spark's text
rendering of the plan, which nothing reads), and the raw `sparkPlanInfo` is released once its plan
tree resolves. On a 3.5 GB decompressed real log this cut parse time 7.8% and peak RSS 21%, with
identical findings.
