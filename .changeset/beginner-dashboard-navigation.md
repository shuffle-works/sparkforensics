Topbar now carries a "New analysis" home button and a persistent Docs link once a run is loaded, since both previously existed only on the landing screen and there was no way back. Finding-type tags that link to a doc page now get a visible underline so they read as linkable at a glance instead of only on hover; `incompleteRun` (INCMP), which had no vendor doc anchor, now links to its SparkForensics guide entry instead of rendering as inert text. FixTheseFirst's grouped-row trailing stat ("×2 · 476ms recoverable") now carries a spelled-out tooltip explaining the shorthand.
