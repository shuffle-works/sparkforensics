The evidence report (CLI md/json, MCP `diagnose_run`, and the dashboard's Export evidence download) no longer lists checks the log could not run as clean. It uses the dashboard's rule: every per-stage check on a log where no stage finished, the run-span checks (`utilization`, `memoryUtilization`, `autoscalingChurn`) on a log with no end-of-run record, and any check whose only finding is a missing-data caveat move from `cleanChecks` to a new `notRunChecks` list. Each entry carries a `reason`, and the Markdown shows them under "Not checked on this log". The summary gains `actionableFindingCount` and `actionableImpactBandCounts`, which leave out evidence caveats and the incomplete-run row as the dashboard's top bar does, and `clean`, the dashboard's clean-run rule. The report's `schemaVersion` is now 4.
