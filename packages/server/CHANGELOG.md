# sparkforensics-server

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 438e1b7: Bump to 0.2.0, rolling up the accumulated feature work since 0.1.0 (HTML
  export, run listing, widget catalog rework, and the other pending fixes)
  into one minor release across all three published packages.

### Patch Changes

- 438e1b7: Fix Executor Utilization and Memory Utilization overstating idle time and
  wasted-memory savings on runs with executor churn (spot preemption,
  `dynamicAllocation` replacement): both now measure real concurrent capacity
  instead of summing every executor that ever existed.
  
  `maxPartitionTooBig`, a hardcoded-critical OOM/crash-risk finding, no longer
  gets silently downgraded on long-running jobs by the generic wall-clock-based
  severity grading; it keeps its critical severity regardless of how small its
  modeled time savings are relative to the run.
  
  Cold Start and Executor Utilization no longer silently skip a run whose
  `startTime` is literally `0`.
  
  Task Skew and Straggler findings on the same stage now call out that they
  can describe the same wasted time and shouldn't be added together. Task
  Skew, Straggler, and GC Pressure now disclose that their thresholds are
  unvalidated, matching other findings with comparable uncertainty.
- 438e1b7: Executor Utilization and Memory Utilization no longer show a "no issues"
  card in the dashboard when they have zero findings; they now collapse into
  the Clean-checks row like every other widget instead of being always
  mounted. Core Usage by Locality keeps the always-mounted treatment.
  
  The CLI's `--format md/json` report and MCP's `diagnose_run` output change
  to match: when Executor or Memory Utilization has zero findings, it's now
  listed under "checked and clean" like every other detector, instead of
  being silently omitted from that section.
- 438e1b7: Add the `list_runs` MCP tool, which finds candidate Spark runs in a local
  directory or on a Spark History Server (by name pattern, date range, capped
  count) before diagnosing one with the other tools.
  
  `stageFailed` and `retryWaste` findings now carry up to 20 sampled
  failed/retried tasks each (task id, attempt number, host, executor, failure
  reason, peak executor memory, spill, shuffle write), instead of only a
  stage-level count. Redaction now walks every field literally named `host`
  anywhere in the findings tree, so these new samples get host-redacted too.
  
  Fix `compare_runs` stage matching under-reporting coverage: identities that
  collide the same number of times on both runs now pair off positionally
  instead of being dropped as ambiguous, and a stage's SQL identity is scoped
  to only the plan nodes that stage actually ran instead of the whole plan
  tree. Together these recover matched coverage on self-comparisons and on
  comparisons involving repeated stage shapes (e.g. a self-join's two Exchange
  stages).
  
  Rework the recommendation copy for slow-host and straggler findings so it no
  longer presumes a hardware fault by default, pointing at data locality and
  `spark.speculation` instead. Stage-slowness recommendation copy now points
  at shuffle-partition tuning. Fix the plan-node-detail parser so operators
  with no dedicated branch (e.g. `InMemoryTableScan`) no longer repeat their
  own name as a duplicate prefix in the parsed detail text.
- 438e1b7: Memory Utilization no longer shows as an active widget when its only
  finding is the `dataUnavailable` caveat (missing evidence because
  `spark.eventLog.logStageExecutorMetrics` wasn't enabled for the run): that
  caveat is already surfaced in the Evidence availability ledger, so it no
  longer counts toward the widget's active-vs-clean decision. It now collapses
  to the Clean-checks row in that case, matching the dashboard bundled into
  the server and into the CLI's `--export-html` output.
- 438e1b7: Add a package README pointing at the main repo README, and make `--help`
  print usage instead of silently starting the server (mcp and server bins).
- 438e1b7: Speed up NDJSON event-log parsing ~4x (byte-scan line splitting, whole-chunk
  decode with substring lines). Make the server bin executable and serve nested
  directory-index requests.
- 438e1b7: Add the `get_reference_doc` MCP tool, which serves the Spark tuning reference
  by anchor. The reference is now sourced from the docs-site markdown chapters
  (single source) instead of vendored built HTML.
- 438e1b7: Rename the vendored Spark Tuning Reference's docs-config directory constant
  from `spark-doc` to `spark-tuning-reference`, matching the real upstream repo
  name and the hub's product-bar surface key.
- 438e1b7: Vendor upstream's per-chapter docs pages instead of a single monolithic
  page, memoize the detector-to-doc-anchor lookup, and single-source the
  bottleneck sub-anchor mapping between docs-config.ts and update-docs.mjs.
